# Example

    from meanshift import *

    X, X_valid, X_test = Cifar10_OneClass(train_classes=[9], balance=False, download=True)[0]
    X, X_valid, X_test = asreshape(X, X_valid, X_test, shape=(3, 32, 32))

    model = DeepMeanShift(features="eff")
    model = model.fit(X, verbose=True)
    scores = model.score(X_valid)

    model.evaluate(X_valid, X_test)
